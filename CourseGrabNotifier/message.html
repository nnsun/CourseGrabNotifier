        <h2>Hurray!</h2>
        <p>
            A course you were tracking on Cornell CourseGrab now has an open slot! Hurry to <a href='https://studentcenter.cornell.edu'><strong>Student Center</strong></a> to snatch it before someone else does!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you get in, be sure to prevent future notifications by visiting <a href='https://coursegrab.me'>CourseGrab</a> and removing the course.
        </p>
        <p>
            If someone beat you to it, sit tight! We'll send you another email as soon as there's an open slot.
        </p>
        <p>
            Good luck!
